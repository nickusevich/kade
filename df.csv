0,8,Just as delightful as the first one!,"I do think the first Shrek is better, but this is a delightful film that is just as funny and imaginative than its predecessor. Here we are introduced to new characters, such as Puss In Boots, marvellously voiced by Antonio Banderras. (Puss's look of innocence with the eyes was so sweet) The original voice cast return and are given fresh and very well-done material that they make the most of. Eddie Murphy mayn't be to everyone's taste, but I personally thought he was very funny, especially when he keeps saying ""Are we there yet?"" The new characters are well done, though I am not hugely fond of Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother, though I really did like John Cleese, Julie Andrews and Rupert Everett. The animation is just as lovely as it was in the first. The only other criticism I have of the movie, is that the plot isn't always as involving as the one in the original. But it is still rock-solid entertainment, for everyone to enjoy. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
1,8,Nice fitting sequel,"After Shrek (Mike Myers) marries Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in the first movie. Donkey (Eddie Murphy) has been watching the hovel while they're on their honeymoon. Then they get a summons from Fiona's parents (Julie Andrews, John Cleese) in Far, Far Away. The trio goes to Fiona's home to find an uneasy acceptance of what has happened. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) returns after not finding Fiona in the tower. He and his mother Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) try to split Shrek away from Fiona. They threaten the King who in turn hires Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to kill Shrek.There are some great additions to the cast of characters in the Shrek world. The main trio's chemistry is maintained while Puss form a new trio with Shrek and Donkey. It is just as good as the first one. It takes the situation and spins it into a family drama. The main idea of acceptance is expanded as the parents try to accept the Ogre into the family. It's a perfectly fitting sequel after the happily ever after."
2,8,Wonderful solid fun,"Ok, I have to admit that the surprise is gone. The original Shrek was irreverent and made fun of all the children stories known to man... The second one is on the same line but by now you expect it. Still it's been a long time since I've seen an entire theater laugh from the start till the end of a movie. Wonderful new characters (you have to love the pussy in boots), superb animation and a all-round well made movie for everyone to enjoy. But please, whatever you do DO NOT read any comments (like this one) before you go see the movie, it can ruin it for you... And watch the credits until the end, there are surprises... Enough said, just enjoy the film, it's guaranteed to make any blues just fade away!"
3,,Proof that god has to be real,"One of the greatest treasures humanity has come across. Breathtaking imagery, intelligent dialogue and well-thought-out characters. A tale of bravery, betrayal, murder and redemption. Shrek as a character is directly influenced by Jesus Christ. He is willing to take all the weight on his shoulders to make save the world from trouble. Shrek 2 is a great movie for family and drinking buddies alike. The ""Pixels"" of my generation. Shrek 2 is a gift sent by god to reward us for keeping faith. Checkmate, Atheists."
4,7,Respectable effort with a tough act to follow,"Shrek 2 has as much humor, talent, and fun as the original classic, and almost as much heart. The film picks up where Shrek left off, with Fiona and Shrek celebrating their marriage, but they are immediately cast into a new adventure when summoned to the land of Far Far Away (a clever parody of Hollywood), to the court of Fiona's mother and father, for a surprise royal wedding ball. The only problem, as it turns out, is that Fiona has married the wrong guy - according to everybody but Shrek, Fiona, and their friends.The plot, revolving around this central problem, is helped along by nearly constant allusions to virtually every fairy tale in the English canon, and satirical references to many recent popular films. Unsatisfied with the combination of romantic comedy, Hollywood satire and self-parody, the film-makers' also went all out with a clever original soundtrack, making Shrek 2 as much of a musical as anything else.The voice talent is just as essential as it was in the first film, and there's more of it, with John Cleese and Antonio Banderas giving very memorable performances. And the animation is, unsurprisingly, lovely.To their credit, Dreamworks kept the core talent in place, but created a somewhat different formula for this film. Even though I expect most fans of the first film to adore the second, I am not sure Shrek 2 is going to make the franchise any new fans. Though more clearly made for adult audiences than the original, Shrek 2 is still warm-hearted family fare. As much as I DO recommend this film, and as entertaining as I think it will be for just about anybody, I don't consider Shrek 2 to be quite the classic Shrek was. It's touching and goofy, to be sure, but it's much more of a Hollywood film than the original, and it doesn't quite reach the same levels. Nevertheless, it is one of the better sequels I have seen, and it was definitely worth both the price of admission and a third or fourth viewing of the DVD."
5,10,Are you serious? I thought Shrek 2 was so much better than the first!,"As much as I enjoyed the first Shrek, I honestly almost died laughing and loving Shrek 2. The first Shrek was sweet and innocent, but the second took us to a different edge with terrific animation and just drop on the floor laughable jokes. Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don't understand why Shrek 2 wasn't on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek?Shrek and Fiona are now married and happy ogres, that is until Fiona's parents wish to see her and her new hubby. Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming, which ruined her fairy godmother and dad's plans, so her dad hires a hit-cat to slay Shrek, but fails, but since Shrek spars his life, the cat stays with Donkey and Shrek. Shrek wants so badly for Fiona to live happily ever after, so he and Donkey take a potion from the fairy godmother and have little time to make sure it stays permanent.Like I said, the Cat was my favorite character, especially when he and Donkey since Livin' La Vida Loca, I thought that it was so cute. Also when he stops the guards in the palace and gives them the cute kitty look. I just don't understand why no one got into the sequel as much as I did, otherwise this would be higher on the rating, and probably above the first Shrek.10/10"
6,7,"It's a Puss in Boots world, we just all live in it","Shrek the Ogre, Pincess Fiona, and Donkey are back in the sequel to the modern day fairy tale classic in this lesser, but still magical sequel. Shrek and Fiona are returning from their honeymoon, only to find a dejected Donkey who broke things off with Dragon apparently and the King's noblemen inviting them to Fiona's parents castle in Faf Far Away. Naturally the anti-social Shrek wants nothing to do with the invitation, but gives in to Fiona and Donkey's insistence. Needless to say the King is quite upset to find his daughter an Ogre and married to Shrek. Add the dastardly vain Prince Charming, a not so good Fairy Godmother and the delightful new addition of Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots, and you get a fun, but ultimately unneeded sequel that treads to closely to the first plot-wise. However children will still love it. Parents will still chuckle every now and then, and it's still one of the better sequel's that I've seen.My Grade: B-Where i saw it: Cinemax on Demand (available till September 9th, 2005)"
7,10,One of the best animated movies ever,"It's the best animated movie, but it's definitely one of the top three Dreamworks movies. The jokes are hysterical, especially the Hawaii Five-O, Garfield, and Annie jokes. However, the humor isn't the only good thing about this movie. The animation is great. There is also a lot of creativity. The most creative thing being the villain bar, made even more creative by the name (Poison Apple). I also think that the film has two of the best Dreamworks villains, Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother. I think the best thing about the story about the part about Shrek and Fiona turning into a human. (Donkey as a horse was funny) I think this is the best part because I think this really makes Shrek and Fiona much more developed. This is a movie I feel comfortable recommending to everybody. Go watch it NOW! (Watch the first Shrek before this film first)"
8,7,A Dream World by DreamWorks,"Shrek has now vanquished the fire-breathing dragon, eradicated the evil Lord Farquaad and married his Princess Fiona. But now he is facing his biggest challenge yet  meeting Fiona's parents in the Land of Far, Far Away. Dreamworks' second animated installment in the Shrek series was the surprise of the year for me, because it really is every bit as funny as its predecessor  but perhaps not as original or novel, and therefore not as memorable.The animation, on the other hand, is perfected this time around. Dreamworks always go all the way in this aspect and the result is top-notch and easily exceeds that of its peers (Pixar, Blue Skye Studios). The greatest showcase for this manifests itself in the beginning of the film as Shrek, Fiona and Donkey set out to the Land of Far, Far Away in a horse-driven carriage and travel across mountains, fields, woods and passes  this journey features such gorgeously striking visuals of its scenery that it just touches me. It is downright aesthetically intoxicating.Its wide-ranging gallery of eccentric characters have also been paid great attention to  this time gloriously supported by A-list actors (John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett)  both in animation and in story. Although Shrek and Fiona are still largely central to the story they now occasionally take a backseat to the new sparkling creatures like Puss-in-Boots, Fairy Godmother, Fiona's parents and yet more of Pinnocchio, Gingie and their crew in the swamp. The film is having a lot of self-referential fun in navigating its many story lines and inside-jokes and it makes no pretense about it. Shrek 2 is therefore positively peppered with rapid-fire dialogue, deadpan humour, pop-culture references and homages (to Ghost Busters, Blazing Saddles, The Lord of the Rings and MORE). It's a little more brave, and a little less serious.The most credit is however due to its score. I'll admit that I don't know much about subtle musical scores in films, nor is it something that I always pick up on, but in Shrek is becomes the film. Eels make a great appearance in the soundtrack, as does alternative rock songs and classic songs (Funkytown - Lipps, Inc.)  it's amazingly catchy and thanks to its continuous scoring (music in some form in nearly every scene) it invests the film in a sort of lyrical flow. It all fits perfectly and smoothly with the fluid animation and the fairytale setting. It's a dream world beautifully captured by Dreamworks.Although its key plot outline of Shrek meeting Fiona's parents and feeling inadequate is well-sketched, it suffers numerous diversions that take the form of jokes, detours and supporting characters, massively straying from the template  all of which you cannot help but feel do not quite belong in the story, and serve only the purpose of blatant humour and homages. There is nothing wrong with that per se, but the film occasionally feels a bit disjointed because of it. Its disorganisation is its fatal flaw but there is another woeful mistake in Shrek 2  its final, cheesy song-and-dancer number at the end. WHY or WHY do so many films fall prey to this horrible device?!Granted, the latter is not enough to ruin a film on its own but it does remind me of a rather nasty approach that you occasionally feel it takes. Letting its actors shine. Parts of Shrek 2 thereby acts more as an elaborate excuse to parade the 'fun, quirky' actors behind the characters (Antonio Banderas' Hispanic accent seems to be an endless source of amusement as far as the film is concerned). This approach, combined with its slight disorganisation makes this sequel slightly inferior to Shrek I. It is, however, a very funny film that caters to all ages.7 out of 10"
9,9,This second movie is  very GOOD,"I imagined this film to be a crap, because it is almost a rule with few exceptions,that second movies are always terrible in comparison with the first ones. But not this one. I cannot say that I liked Shrek2 more then the first, but the second one is very good too: New characters as the Fairy Godmother,Prince Charming,Puss In Boots and Fiona's parents are introduced to us, and a new reality comes, with Shrek and Fiona's relationship going to a deeper step,and new confusions because of their wedding.One of the good surprises, was that neither Shrek or Fiona changed to the human form;I was almost sure that they would,but I think that the movie would loose its magic. By the way: The voice of the new characters really rules! But Julie Andrews, John Cleese and Rupert Everett only could do a great job.:) I liked Antonio Bandeiras as Puss In Boots as well! He really surprised me! (Usually, I hate his strong accent)"
10,6,Better then the original,"Shrek 2 is a fun movie to watch for the whole family and it improves over the original. Shrek 2 continues the story with Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) going with his new wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz), to meet his in-laws, the King and Queen of the Kingdom of Far Far Away, which bears more than a resemblance to Beverly Hills. But are they ready for their new ogre son-in-law and their daughter's new look? The King (voiced by John Cleese) seems to have his own plans and he enlists the aid of the Fairy Godmother and Puss in Boots to get what he wants. They plot is good and the execution is pretty good considering that most animated sequels are pretty cheap. I thought the first Shrek was okay nothing special but this one was a lot more funnier. I think what makes this movie work better then the first is the additional characters. Puss In Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas is hilarious and I thought he was a good addition to the cast. Of course having Mike Myers as Shrek was funny too and Eddie Murphy is still to annoying and he was the only reason why I didn't give this movie a ten. Cameron Diaz is good too but I felt she didn't really do anything special. Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese are all great additions to the cast and make this movie charming. The movie is quick and short but is able to leave so many funny moments you wonder why other comedies don't try this hard. Shrek 2 is the best kids movie I have seen this year and proves that even with a simplistic plot you can still let adults enjoy it. The story, the characters, the direction and the dialog are all smart and funny. Rating 8/10 perfect movie except for Eddie Murphy and everyone should watch."
11,9,Why I Liked 'Shrek 2' Better,"I much preferred this sequel, even though I also liked the original, too, as millions of other viewers - kids and adults - did. This second edition, to me, was better than the first one for the following reasons:1 - A faster-paced story; 2 - Better colors, just gorgeous with a 3-D effect in spots; 3 - another great combination of humor, adventure and romance; 4 - no one segment of the story overstayed its welcome; 5 - Eddie Murphy's character wasn't played up as much, meaning less abrasive shouting in this film; 6 - a genuine touching ending which left the viewer very satisfied.Some of these qualities were all there in abundance in first Shrek, too, but the package was more complete here. It was softer, kindler, gentler Shrek film than the first. Murphy is a funny guy but his incessant talking can get on anyone's nerves, but with less to say, that didn't happen in this sequel."
12,7,"Doesn't quite match the first film, but good fun anyway","Shrek 2 keeps the wining trio of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy, and it throws in the comic genius of John Cleese and Jennifer Saunders as well. The freshness of the first film has gone, but that is not to say that this sequel is stale, far from it! It still has plenty of new gags and parody's, and it successfully plays on a few 'in jokes' from Shrek's first outing.The only problem i can see here, is this, the magic has worn off a little, (despite the introduction of the fairy god-mother) and it does leave the movie just a shade behind the original.A Good sequel, and i can't wait for Shrek 3, but i suspect it may disappoint (lets hope not)7/10"
13,3,Blockbuster literacy cannot replace a plot,"I am baffled. How can viewers say this is better than the original?! Its plot is thin, twists slow and few, characters hollow and underused... And most of the funnier moments come from the indispensable visual quoting of blockbusters (Alien, Lord of the Rings, etc., prompting a pathetic ""did you spot them all"" quest), in a poor display of cinema under-literacy. The only positive point is the technical improvement, but who cares about this? Shrek managed to be much, much funnier despite its matchstick people. The welcome infusion of new characters is a wasted effort, as none of them offer more than an inconsistent set of one-liners: the fairy godmother and Puss in boots are particularly disappointing, with only a couple of interesting scenes each, lost in a sea of contradicting and threadbare interaction. Key scenes are embarrassingly low on laughs (come on!, 5 minutes into the movie, the ""are we there yet?/no"" sequence felt like half an hour! I stopped laughing at such jokes when I was 3!). All in all, I'm very sorry to say that the few amusing moments are not worth the hour-and-a-half session. The original featured complex fun that made it very enjoyable for kids and grown-ups alike; I doubt children will even like this one (too slow, not exciting enough), and adults will hate it. I did. 3/10"
14,,Wonderful!,"The first time I watched this movie was in my living room with my husband, daughter, and mom. We all laughed so hard we had to watch it again to see what we missed (which turned out to be a lot!). Antonio as Puss was genius! As was Jennifer Saunders as the fairy godmother. Kudos to the casting director. Once again Eddie Murphy as the annoying and talkative donkey was perfect and even much more lovable. And Mike Myers as Shrek, what can I say? A perfect grumpy ogre. Cameron Diaz once again lets her personality shine through even in animation. Oh, and Rupert! With that voice being the narcissistic Prince Charming. I could go on and on about the characters in this movie but instead I implore you to watch it for yourself. I loved this movie as did my entire family. The jokes in this movie were absolutely delicious! For those naysayers who hated this movie, I say go buy a sense of humor!"
15,7,Better than the first one,"I was not very impressed by the first ""Shrek"" film and was expecting the same sort of sentiments for the second film. But when I saw it (only yesterday as a matter of fact), I was pleasantly surprised to find it was better. As usual, Eddie Murphy is great as Donkey, but the show is completely stolen by Puss in Boots who is brought alive by the voice of Antonio Banderas. John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett and Jenniffer Saunders are among the new cast. There are some great gags and some wonderful spoofs of a number of films, one of the best spoofs being one of ""Mission Impossible"". But this film is no masterpiece; it suffers a bit from the same problems as ""Shrek (1)"": after a while it gets boring watching the two ogres farting and burping continuously. Still, it is worth seeing, even just for Puss in Boots. Enjoy. 7/10"
16,9,More Shrekervescence!,"I know what you're expecting me to say. ""If you liked Shrek ..."" And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.At the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well.Shrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.As with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.Shrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme."
17,6,Funny but charmless,"One of the successful things about the original Shrek was its combination of a children's story with gags that adults would enjoy. This sequel focuses on the gags and forgets almost entirely about story. A key sign of this is the number of situations or events that have no real purpose in the story outside of their, alightly adult, gag-value. The introduction of modern life into the story is also an extremely lame ploy to get cheap laughs, and lucrative commercial tie-ins. It's a fun film, with great performances from Jennifer Saunders and Antonio Banderas, but it's irritatingly 'knowing' and smacks of the media in-joke cynicism that the first film so successfully, and subtly, satirised. I felt a bit uncomfortable watching it with the kids."
18,10,Masterpiece,This movie is an absolute masterpiece...nothing more that has to be said
19,7,More entertainment from Myers and Co.,"The original Shrek was enjoyable, if forgettable, entertainment. It worked better than most films of it's type because it was a fresh and original take on the classic fairytale and beneath it's over the top characters and general bravado, there was a rather touching love story that allowed audiences to care more than they would for the average animated picture. The sequel picks up where the original left off and sees Shrek and his bride, Princess Fiona visit her parents, much to Shrek and father's dismay. You see, Ogres aren't welcome at her father's palace, especially not when they're wed to his beloved daughter, and life is made very hard for our hero indeed. This prompts him, along with his trusty steed; the imaginatively titled 'Donkey', to set off on a quest to find a potion to put things right so that he and his princess will be able to live happily ever after (fairytale style!).This film isn't any better than the original, nor is it any worse; the two are on par with one another in terms of quality, and just different. Whereas the first film offered a love story, this one is more about acceptance and superficiality, and it actually works quite well. Of course, the message will no doubt be lost on the film's target audience (children), who will just enjoy the animation and fun of the picture, but the rest of us can enjoy the message. Also to be enjoyed about this film is the amount of film tributes - I counted many and probably missed a couple, but the most obvious ones are Alien and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The animation of the film is fabulous and undoubtedly DreamWorks' best yet. Even the regular humans in the tale look fine, and I have yet to say that for any other animated picture since this computer animation craze started. Shrek 2 also benefits from a number of big name voice actors including, obviously, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy, but also John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews and Jennifer Saunders add their voices to the impressive roster, and not to mention Antonio Banderas in the memorable role of 'Puss in Boots'.Overall, like the first one; this isn't a great film. But it is great entertainment, and for that reason it is hard to dislike, and I recommend it if you like films of that nature."
20,10,Excellent and Worthwhile Sequel,"When Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon, they receive an invitation of Fiona's royal parents for a dinner party in their castle. Shrek does not want to go, but he is convinced by Fiona to visit her parents, who do not know that they are ogres. They go with the company of Donkey to the Far Far Away kingdom to meet the Queen and the King. Expecting for a beautiful Fiona and an enchanted prince, the King is completely disappointed by Fiona's choice, and plot an evil plan against Shrek with the Fairy Godmother, who wants that her son Prince Charming marries Fiona. The sword fighting cat Puss-in-Boots is also hired by the King to kill Shrek, who is helped by his friends to recover Fiona. I glanced the tough titles of some user comments and I am not sure whether these viewers saw the same film as I did. I usually hate sequels, but 'Shrek 2' is an excellent and lovely sequel, in the same level of the first one, having lots of funny jokes and details. The kiss of Shrek and Fiona on the beach à la Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in 'From Here To Eternity' would be enough to make 'Shrek 2' a worthwhile movie. I saw 'Shrek 2' in the original English audio, and now I intend to see it again spoken in Portuguese. The dubbing in Portuguese in the first 'Shrek' was perfect, and I want check how it is in this sequel. ""Shrek 2"" is an entertainment recommended for the whole family. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Shrek 2"""
21,7,I haven't laughed this much in a long time!,"Wow, I just saw Shrek 2 (Wed, May 19) and it was great! I was a little apprehensive about a Shrek sequel since the first was so great and wrapped up so nicely at the end. Often, the sequels do not match up in this kind of movie and the plot tends to be thin. Shrek 2 is equally as good as the first one! The new characters are great, especially Puss in Boots. There are so many jokes and parodies of other movies and pop culture that I know I missed a lot of them because I was already laughing so hard. I need to see it again to catch them all! It is also a very clean movie, with no questionable material for kids to see. Many of the jokes will go over their heads, so this makes for a very entertaining movie for adults too. Several characters from the first one are back and are fun to see again. One of my favorites, the Gingerbread Man, is back and gets even more screen time! The plot is entertaining also, and ends with a good moral lesson like the first one did. We should all love others for who you they are and don't change to please others!! The use of popular music is also good and works well with the story. Of course, the animation is incredible and many times I forgot I was watching animation since it looks so much like live action. Also, make sure you stay during the credits because there's another short scene in there! I recommend it to anyone, and give it an 8/10!!!"
22,9,"Myers, Murphy, and Diaz do it again in SHREK 2!","So, remember how long SHREK was in theaters? Remember how many times you laughed? Well, SHREK 2 brings back all the excitement and laughter! Myers stars again as Shrek, Murphy as the hilarious Donkey, and Diaz as Fiona.(SPOILERS)After their honeymoon, Fiona asks Shrek to go with her to see her parents. At first, Shrek isn't sure if it's a good idea. But, whether he likes it or not, he is soon persuaded by Fiona to go to the kingdom of Far Far Away. Donkey asks/decides that he'll come along, and soon enough the three are on their way.Once they reach the palace, Shrek and the King (Cleese) clash immediately. King soon takes matters in his own hands when he hires Puss In Boots (Banderas)to ""get rid"" of Shrek. In the meantime, Shrek and Donkey don't seem to be getting along so well. Puss fails, and becomes Shrek's new friend. Donkey gets jealous, but sticks with Shrek nonetheless.The three then steal a potion from the potion factory to make Shrek and Fiona's marriage go on forever so that they can live happily ever after. Donkey tests the potion and then Shrek drinks it. The next day, Shrek wakes up to be human, and Donkey a stallion. The potion also affects Fiona, however, and she becomes her once beautiful self.Seeing this as an excellent opportunity to get her son, Prince Charming, with Fiona, Fairy Godmother gives King a love potion. She tells King that the love potion is to be poured into a drink, then drinken by Fiona. The first man Fiona kisses at the Royal Celebration Ball, becomes her new love. King feels guilty and secretly puts the love potion into his drink, which is later on discovered.Meanwhile, Shrek, Puss, and Donkey catch up with their old buddies after being arrested. Their friends free them and take them to see the Muffin Man. The Muffin Man builds a big gingerbread man to crash through the gates of the palace during the Royal Celebration Ball, giving Shrek a chance to see Fiona again.Shrek makes it in time, but the giant gingerbread man falls apart. After Fiona kisses Prince Charming, Fairy Godmother realizes that King drank the love potion himself (because Fiona knocks out Prince Charming). Shrek and Fiona then turn back into ogres and leave Far Far Away, after forgiving King."
23,7,Great!,Definitely doesn't suffer from lacking-sequel syndrome. I remember loving this equally in comparison to its predecessor. Saw it in the theater.
24,2,"I've Seen Worse Movies, I think ...","A typical sequel. Less talented and less inspired writers try to figure out how to get some mileage out of what others created. The pressure to meet the deadline was obvious. Attempts at humor just fall with a thud. You can hear the writer's meeting: ""Um, yeah, that's funny.""Just hearing the script from the first Shrek sends me into convulsions. I can repeat a good chunk of it from memory, because it's wry, chewy, stick to your ribs humor. (""Parfait gotta be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet."") Virtually nothing about ""Shrek 2"" is worth remembering. It's predictable, it's preachy, it's decidedly lame. Nearly all the jokes were stolen from other movies, or are very obvious swipes at modern life.I think it's better than ""Teenagers from Outer Space"" but not as good as ""Muscle Beach Party."" That makes it two stars out of ten."
